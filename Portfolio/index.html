                <p>Hi! My name is Jedika Sinaga and I am currently a <strong>TechHire student</strong> at Laguardia Community College and part-time receptioninst at an optometry office. At TechHire, my colleagues and I are learning to become a full stack web developer, which includes <strong>HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java.</strong></p>
            
                <p>I am a highly motivated and proactive individual with over 8 years of experience in the resturant and hospitality industry. I also come from a very big family with over 30 cousins! My adaptive and problem solving abilities allow me to be an efficient team leader and energetic team member. Working in the service industry has allowed me to interact with all different walks of life. I learned how to pick up peoples' niches and turn those preferences into potential sale revenue. My work skills has set me apart from most people by simply being more personable. I have worked under high stress levels, labor intensive enviornments, and with a phenomenal array of personalities. </p>
